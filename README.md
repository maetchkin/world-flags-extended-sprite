# The silouettes of all countries regions in the world in one sprite

Include 1 css file and have all the worlds' regions silouettes on your site. Tell everyone who uses a lot of regions silouettes to use this link, so it will be in everyone's cache!

## Example usage:

In the head of your html file:

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    type="text/css"
    href="//cloud.github.com/downloads/marcolino/world-regions-silouettes-sprite/flags32.css"
/>
```

In the body of your html file:

```html
<ul class="f32">
  <li class="flag north-america">Northern America</li>
  <li class="flag south-europe">Southern Europe</li>
  <li class="flag west-asia">Western Asia</li>
  ...
</ul>
```

The regions corresponding to the codes are:
  'america':              America
  'north-america':        Northern America
  'caribbean':            Caribbean
